# Documentation for dispatch

Documentation is written in [markdown][] format with [pandoc][] extensions. We
use [pandoc][] to generate formatted documentation such as man pages, HTML and
PDF.

All markdown, HTML and PDF documentation is installed in the share/doc
directory. Man pages are also installed in the standard share/man location.

The Qpid website also has documentation for each release.

Sub-directories:

`book/`: Book-format documentation.

`man/`: Unix man pages.

`api/`: Generated API documentation.

`notes/`: Developer notes: project information, design notes, or anything else
that's primarily of developer interest. These are not installed.
