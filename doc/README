# Building documentation

You can disable building documentation entirely with:

    cmake -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF

By default it is enabled automatically if you have the required tools. For a yum
based system you can install these packages:

- pandoc (1.12) for HTML book and man pages.
- pandoc-pdf (1.12) for `pdflatex` program needed to build PDF version of the book.
- doxygen (1.8) for API documentation.
- graphviz (2.34) for `dot` program needed to include diagrams in API documentation.

The versions above are known to work, earlier versions may or may not. If you
find an earlier version does work please update this README.

If you have a subset of these tools, you will get a subset of the output.

You can enable/disable specific tools with these cmake options:
    USE_PANDOC, USE_PDFLATEX, USE_DOXYGEN, USE_DOT.


# Writing documentation

Documentation is written in [markdown][] format with [pandoc][] extensions. We
use [pandoc][] to generate formatted documentation such as man pages, HTML and
PDF.

[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax"

[pandoc]: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown "Pandoc markdown syntax"

All documentation is installed in the share/doc directory. Man pages are also
installed in the standard share/man/man* locations.

The [dispatch web site](http://qpid.apache.org/components/dispatch-router) has
pre-generated documentation for each release and a random snapshot of the trunk.

Sub-directories (each has a README with more specifics):

- `book/`: Book-format documentation.
- `man/`: Unix man pages.
- `api/`: Generated API documentation.
- `notes/`: Developer notes: project information, design notes, or anything else
that's primarily of developer interest. These are not installed.
