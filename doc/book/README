# Editing the book.

Most chapters of the book are simply [markdown][] files. Edit the chapter file
to edit the book.

[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax"

The chapters are listed in the variable BOOK in CMakeLists.txt, update that variable if
you add or re-order chapters.

Some chapters are generated by python scripts rather than being simple source
files. For example `schema.md` is generated by `schema_md.py` from the
documentation strings in the management schema `qdrouterd.json`.

It is *much* better to capture external documentation automatically than to
cut/paste or re-type it into the book. Duplicated information becomes
inconsistent almost immediately.  The initial effort will be repaid manyfold.
