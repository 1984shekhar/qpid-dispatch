# How man pages are generated.

Man pages are generated from markdown sources.

Command line tools --help option provides a very brief usage and list of
options.  Man pages should be more detailed, but we do not want to repeat the
option information from --help as it will easily become out of date.

A small python script helt2md.py combines the manpage markdown source named
*.noopt.md with the output of "program --help" into a single markdown file.

The final man page is generated from the markdown by pandoc.
