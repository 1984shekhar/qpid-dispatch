.\" XXX .SH SYNTAX
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "'container' section"
.IP container-name
The name of the AMQP container.  If not specified, the container name
will be set to a value of the container's choosing.  The automatically
assigned container name is not guaranteed to be persistent across
restarts of the container.
.IP worker-threads
The number of threads that will be created to process message traffic
and other application work (timers, non-amqp file descriptors, etc.)
.SS "'ssl-profile' section"
.IP
Zero or more SSL profiles may be defined and then referenced later in
listeners (for incoming connections) or connectors (for outgoing
connectors).
.IP name
The name of the profile to be referenced later.
.IP cert-db
The path to the database that contains the public certificates of
trusted certificate authorities (CAs).
.IP cert-file
The path to the file containing the PEM-formatted public certificate
to be used on the local end of any connections using this profile.
.IP key-file
The path to the file containing the PEM-formatted private key for the
above certificate.
.IP password-file
If the above private key is password protected, this is the path to a
file containing the password that unlocks the certificate key.
.IP password
An alternative to storing the password in a file referenced by
password-file is to supply the password right here in the
configuration file.  This option can be used by supplying the password
in the 'password' option.  Don't use both password and password-file
in the same profile.
.SS "'listener' and 'connector' sections"
.IP addr
The listener or connector IP address
.IP port
The listener or connector port
.IP sasl-mechanisms
A list of accepted SASL mechanisms
.SS "'router' section"
.IP mode
One of "standalone", "interior", or "edge".  In standalone mode, the
router operates as a single component.  It does not participate in the
routing protocol and therefore will not coorperate with other routers.
In interior mode, the router operates in cooreration with other
interior routers in an interconnected network.  In edge mode, the
router operates with an uplink into an interior router network. Edge
routers are typically used as connection concentrators or as security
firewalls for access into the interior network.
.IP router-id
Each router \fIis\fP assigned a router-id that is unique.  For interior
router mode only.
