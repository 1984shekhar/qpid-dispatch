# The qdrouter management schema

The schema `qdrouterd.json` is a JSON format file that defines annotations and
entity types of the Qpid Dispatch Router management model.  The model is based
on the AMQP management specification.

The schema is a JSON map with the following keys:

- "description": documentation string for the schema
- "prefix": Prefix prepended to schema names when they are exposed to AMQP management clients.

- "entityTypes": map of entity type names to definitions (see below)

Annotation and entity type definition maps have the following keys:

- "description": documentation string.
- "operations": list of allowed operation names.
- "attributes": map of attribute names to attribute definitions (see below)

Entity type definitions also have these fields:

- "extends": Name of base type. The new type includes operations and attributes from the base type.
- "annotations": List of annotation names. The new type includes operations and attributes from all the annotations.

Attribute definition maps have the following fields:

- "type": one of the following:
  - "String": a unicode string value.
  - "Integer": an integer value.
  - "Boolean": a true/false value.
  - [...]: A list of strings is an enumeration. Values must be one of the strings or an integer integer index into the list, starting from 0.
- "default": a default can be a literal value or a reference to another attribute in the form `$attributeName`.

There is the following hierarchy among entity types:

`entity`: The base of all entity types.
- `configurationEntity`: base for all types that hold *configuration information*.

  Configuration information is supplied in advance and expresse *intent*. For
  example "I want the router to listen on port N". All the entities that can be
  used in the configuration file extend `configurationEntity`.

- `operationalEntity`: base for all types that hold *operational information*.

  Operational information reflects the actual current state of the router.  For
  example, "how many addresses are presently active?" All the entities queried
  by the `qdstat` tool extend `operationalEntity`.

The two types are often related. For example `listener` and `connector` extend
`configurationEntity`, they express the intent to make or receive
connections. `connection` extends `operationalEntity`, it holds information
the actual connection status.
